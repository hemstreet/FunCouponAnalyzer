        "content": "&quot;There is certainly a possibility that we will go up marginally between now and then, but retail isn&apos;t going to take it there &quot;    I guess it depends on what you mean by &quot;up marginally&quot;.  At one time the share price of this company was almost 3 times what it is now.  That was without any institutional buying, with no revenues, with little to no product validation or partnerships and when it was still an OTC stock. So becoming a 3 to 5 bagger from here is certainly within the realm of possibility even without institutional interest.      So put me down for $15 per share BEFORE the big guys decide to get in and take it to the moon. OK?    "

However, that being said, it sure demonstrates what just 1 fund can do to the SP in short order!  Imagine if 2 or 3 decided to jump in!  AND....it is known that Sheldon was personally buying the past couple of months and is now possibly the 2nd largest shareholder after Uncle Cyrus.  I could see retail slowly melting this up in the coming months to the $8-$10 range, depending on what the shorts throw at it.  Don&apos;t get me wrong....everything is looking fabulous with tonnes more to come, but I am tempering my enthusiasm with the reality of how long these things normally take - but then again, they are still executing much faster than expected.  Have to keep in mind that all this stuff is still pretty cutting edge for the average company/govt dept.  Seems to me that everything is being executed pretty darn well to this point."

Since the beginning of the yr rates rose from the 20% range, thru the 30&apos;s%, peaked in the 50&apos;s% in mid-March and since then have been gradually declining to the mid-20&apos;s% now.  In and of itself this would suggest that shorting peaked in March, but that&apos;s clearly not the case so it&apos;s difficult to know how to interpret what&apos;s going on.    "

I thought you would have been more excited than that, seeing how MSFT sees us playing a big role in their Cloud Azure,.. (filling in alot of GAPS)!!    I am so looking forward to June 16th in New York,... Let me know as soon as you know that you will be attending. It think it will be our big introduction to the investment community.    Also have you found ANY other companies where MSFT made a video of them,... I&apos;m sure it won&apos;t take you long!    I am so looking forward to seeing that video!    All the best!"
