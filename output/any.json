        "content": "Post of the day and it came very early in the morning! Thanks common , it was nice waking up to some logic!  Below is a chart with a few stocks compared gains with ANY over 2 years time to date!!      The short whining is getting old on this board.  Bottom line this will be taken care of as the fundamentals for Sphere become clearer, nothing we can do about it today, period!  The larger problem right now is the flippers and traders, this is what is holding the stock down.  Many longs give the impression they need a stock psychiatrist in their daily post with worry and short fear!!  This is a low float company who is just starting to get the story to the street after combining 4 companies into one, first quarter not even released YET!!      My guess we have atleast 50% of longs that are trading around their core and some others setting tight stop loses, well just gives the impression that the shorts are in control.  Example, a short from yahoo yesterday claimed there was zero shares to short so our dip had zero to do with that!  Flippers, traders and stop loses on a Friday took the steam out of the stock!    This stock is up over 200% in 2 years with the shorts along for the ride!  Sphere continues to execute with top notch precision imo and this will be well known as we go through year and when it does WE will love the SHORTS, you&apos;ll see!!    Hang tough, when things get tough read PB&apos;s article, this comes from a true visionary with a spotless background who imo with Michael Keen is making the calls on the future for Sphere and that makes me sleep good at night!    https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/success-product-doing-everything-else-right-peter-bookman          http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=ANY+Interactive#%7B%22range%22%3A%222y%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%2C%22comparisons%22%3A%7B%22TROV%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23009999%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%2C%22ONVO%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23ff00ff%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%2C%22%5EGSPC%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%239900ff%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%2C%22MSFT%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%231c4587%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%2C%22F%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23cc0000%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%7D%7D"

        "content": "Just imagine 2 years ago some very wealthy doubters shorted Sphere under a dollar thinking this reverse merger company could never create ANY product that could make money.  It&apos;s pretty common for these kind of companies to come out and dilute stock time and time again.  Ut oh, Sphere doesn&apos;t dilute and another visionary (SS) finds this hidden gem and his followers buy in to the vision.  Right out of the gate the shorts are in trouble!!      As of today we have 4 companies combined with 35 million outstanding shares ALL amazingly done with minimal dilution, almost unheard of imo!      Now this group is down over 200% on their short position which is well over a million shares, possible 3-4 million.  How much money is that?  Do they cover or try to fight and create doubt for as long as they can??      I can assure you that they never dreamed that our little reverse merger company from Canada would now have 4 companies combined, lead by visionaries PB and MK :)))  Heading into roadshows with MICROSOFT!!    Bottom line the shorts are cooked it&apos;s just a matter of time!    Let it go and focus on the business, what PT has accomplished in two years is completely unreal, the companies combine heading into a market comparable to the internet back in the late 90&apos;s!  New products, great new hires, and now great partnerships!!!    Here are some of the shorts arguments as of today, which of course has changed as Sphere continues to shoot their theories down!  They have no money, they have no products, PT last job he did a bad job,  Microsoft is a mirage this isn&apos;t news......COME ON LOL, This is insane!!!    The early shorts are cooked, yes they will be new one just like every other stock on the market.  Business results are like a can of RAID for bugs, they will kill off the shorts and when that day comes enjoy your profits!!    Eliminate Glassware just for a second and take Overland Storage, V3 and Tandberg, give those products to visionaries for the New Cloud and you could easily turn this company into and viable business that could easily hold the market cap of where we are today $150 million.    Throw in Glassware at $150 million market cap there is zero risk here IMO!!!  This company is not worth less then this with $160 million run rate!      PS colmar welcome to the board, great first post and backs my therory on the hardware side with the market cap!     &quot;the affiliation with Ingram&apos;s Promark is important &quot;  Revenues from hardware could easily give this company a higher market cap then $150 million!

        "content": "Before, I thought, how balsy it is for Sphere 3D to parade Next GENERATION virtualization and storage over their website and conferences such as in  the Credit Suisse investor presentation.   And we were all googo over Dell and Sphere while Microsoft was actually the TIGER they want to grab...and they grabbed it all right.    Here&apos;s my weekend summary again bear with me...the recent roadshow PR gave a lot of clues that I&apos;m sticking to my nose.  Was it COMA that was asking about the Hyper V container?  YES YES YES!  I&apos;m certainly not a techy, but I&apos;ve read enough from Microsoft gurus that it this new container tech has been dimmed out of the limelight, so MS can work their way up where Google and Amazon is in the cloud.  While they were using Docker and Core OS...MS was busy with ANY.  ********************  Last October, Microsoft and Docker, Inc. jointly announced plans to bring containers to developers across the Docker and Windows ecosystems via Windows Server Containers, available in the next version of Windows Server. We will be unveiling the first live demonstration in a few weeks, starting at the BUILD conference. Today, we are taking containerization one step further by expanding the scenarios and workloads developers can address with containers:    Hyper-V Containers, a new container deployment option with enhanced isolation powered by Hyper-V virtualization.  Nano Server, a minimal footprint installation of Windows Server that is highly optimized for the cloud, and ideal for containers.  First-of-Their-Kind Hyper-V Containers  Leveraging our deep virtualization experience, Microsoft will now offer containers with a new level of isolation previously reserved only for fully dedicated physical or virtual machines, while maintaining an agile and efficient experience with full Docker cross-platform integration. Through this new first-of-its-kind offering, Hyper-V Containers will ensure code running in one container remains isolated and cannot impact the host operating system or other containers running on the same host.  While Hyper-V containers offer an additional deployment option between Windows Server Containers and the Hyper-V virtual machine, you will be able to deploy them using the same development, programming and management tools you would use for Windows Server Containers. In addition, applications developed for Windows Server Containers can be deployed as a Hyper-V Container without modification, providing greater flexibility for operators who need to choose degrees of density, agility, and isolation in a multi-platform, multi-application environment.    http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/04/08/microsoft-unveils-new-container-technologies-for-the-next-generation-cloud/  **************************  If you&apos;re wondering what the &quot;new container technologies&quot; in Windows Server Next will be, join the club. I thought Microsoft might be using its Microsoft Research Drawbridge technologies to provide this functionality, but I hear from my contacts that this is not the case. Microsoft officials are not providing any specifics at this time about the coming container technologies. Maybe we&apos;ll hear more on this front when Microsoft makes the next major preview available of Windows Server Next &#x2014; something sources say is targeted for January 2015 or so.  http://www.zdnet.com/article/docker-container-support-coming-to-microsofts-next-windows-server-release/  ************************  In essence, Microsoft has created a software isolation layer that is not as rigid or heavy as a Hyper-V virtual machine but that can wrap around a bunch of Windows processes and behave like a Docker container, at least conceptually. This Hyper-V Container is not the same thing as a Windows Server Container, which is Microsoft&#x2019;s implementation of Docker, but rather a different kind of virtualization animal. The main point Microsoft wants to stress without giving away too much is that the Docker Engine it is creating in conjunction with Docker for Windows Server will be able to control both Windows Server Containers and Hyper-V Containers.    http://www.theplatform.net/2015/04/08/with-nano-server-and-containers-microsoft-takes-on-linux/  **********************  Sphere 3D and Microsoft &quot;Technologies to Power the Next Cloud&quot; Events    Please join Sphere 3D and Microsoft for an exclusive event to discover the technologies that will drive the &#x201C;Next Cloud&#x201D; for your business\tSphere 3D    You are invited to the Sphere 3D / Microsoft roadshow. The events will be held at Microsoft Technology Centers in Silicon Valley, New York, London and Toronto, and provide an overview of Sphere 3D&#x2019;s technologies and solutions for the &quot;Next Cloud&quot; featuring Glassware 2.0 Windows container technology for application delivery and the latest in virtual storage technology.     Adoption of cloud-based deployment models continues to accelerate and so does the need for the evolution of the associated architectures and business models to ensure success. This means enabling new and innovative capabilities that support public, private, and hybrid deployments in the cloud.    At these events attendees will explore how new technologies are enabling organizations to easily virtualize and migrate legacy and Windows-based applications to the cloud. In addition, attendees will be able to participate in demonstrations of new container based technologies for virtualizing applications, regardless of their hardware or operating system platform dependencies, and get a glimpse at new virtual storage options for the enterprise.    Thats all folks!  As I said, this last PR put it all together.  And they are unveiling this next week???  And ANY is in town??? Coincidence?  Don&apos;t think so.  MS may not be naming Sphere as above but the pieces of this puzzle is coming together.  Excited for my self and for all the longs!  "

        "content": "Promark: Sphere 3D Corporation (ANY) a leading provider of virtualization technology and data management solutions, today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Overland Storage, has expanded its distribution agreement with Promark, a premier U.S.-focused value-added distributor (VAD) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingram Micro, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, Promark will offer Sphere 3D&#x2019;s virtualization product solutions and continue to offer the Overland Storage portfolio in the U.S.    Sphere 3D&#x2019;s virtualization solutions include the V3 series of purpose-built hyper-converged appliances for enterprise VDI and desktop cloud computing. The V3 platform consolidates the server and storage tiers into a single, integrated appliance, and through its unique and highly distributable architecture, is capable of delivering data center performance at multi-site environments. Seamless data center level integration is accomplished by housing every system and software-critical component within hyper-converged appliances, and shipping them pre-tuned for easy deployment. V3 scales virtual desktops in increments of 50, 100, or 200 Windows desktops, with guaranteed performance regardless of worker type. Simplified management is achieved through the V3 Desktop Cloud Orchestrator&#x2122; (DCO) software, which acts as a single pane of glass for provisioning, management and deployment of virtual desktop images, pools and infrastructure.    V3&apos;s distributed hyper-converged architecture is different from other integrated and hyper-converged monolithic solutions that often require rip and replace of existing infrastructure. V3 appliances can seamlessly integrate with a customer&#x2019;s already deployed IT infrastructure, offering unmatched flexibility and choice including use of existing on or offsite storage infrastructure. With substantially less hardware to support, and the ability to perform distributed deployments of virtual desktops through a single user-friendly interface, customers benefit from simplified IT management and reduced total cost of ownership.    &#x201C;Promark has the market knowledge and experience required to effectively bring our disruptive virtualization products to market,&#x201D; said Eric Kelly, chairman and CEO of Sphere 3D. &#x201C;This alliance with Overland Storage and Promark is an important strategic addition to our established, worldwide channel partner infrastructure that will allow us to accelerate the adoption of our differentiated products and solutions, and enable VAR partners to maximize their business opportunities.&#x201D;    &#x201C;End users and IT solutions providers are looking for choices and flexibility as they embrace cloud mobility and the relentless data growth in their environments,&#x201D; said Todd Hartung, vice president of Promark. &#x201C;Our expanded relationship with Overland Storage and parent company Sphere 3D expands our solution portfolio, delivering more choice to our channel partners and empowering them to meet the expanding IT requirements of end users.&#x201D;    About Promark Technology  Promark Technology, an Ingram Micro company is one of the premier value added distributors (VAD) in the United States.
