Money owed by customers (individuals or corporations) to another entity in exchange for goods or services that have been delivered or used, but not yet paid for. Receivables usually come in the form of operating lines of credit and are usually due within a relatively short time period, ranging from a few days to a year.    On a public company&apos;s balance sheet, accounts receivable is often recorded as an asset because this represents a legal obligation for the customer to remit cash for its short-term debts    "

If one wants to take it further and protect the mark, then one goes ahead and apply for registration of the mark, when and if the application is approved then one can start using the letter R for Registered Mark. In the case of Mucho Macho, the mark has not been approved for registration but they&apos;re entitled to usethe TM anytime they want.

Jan-Feb-Mar (1st Qtr) + 45 days = ~May 14 or so, just as someone else responded to me when I inquired earlier.    Why would you consider them &apos;late&apos;, it&apos;s only April 25th?    http://investdaily.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/759/~/how-long-after-the-close-of-each-quarter-do-companies-report-earnings%3F    How long after the close of each quarter do companies report earnings?    Publicly held companies are required to report earnings to the SEC within 45 days of the end of their first three fiscal quarters and within 90 days of the end of their fiscal year. However, most companies release their results much earlier through press releases. The majority of announcements start a couple of weeks after the end of March, June, September and December.      Wall Street analysts make estimates on future earnings on an ongoing basis and update them as often as they deem necessary. Companies themselves sometimes issue &quot;guidance&quot; on upcoming earnings. "

        "content": "What Is Accounts Receivable and Why Does it Matter?        If Accounts Receivable is just sales, it&apos;s basically money in the proverbial bank, right? Not exactly. In the accounting world, Accounts Receivable is sort of like cash inflow &#x201C;in waiting.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s cash legally owed to you, which in theory is good, but it&#x2019;s not cash in hand. The same thing applies to accounts receivable. So exactly what is Accounts Receivable? Let&#x2019;s break it down&#x2026;      So What is Accounts Receivable Anyway?    When you make a sale and have delivered the product or performed the service, but your customer has yet to pay you for it, that amount of money is still coming to you. Cash &#x201C;to be received&#x201D; is filed under the category Accounts Receivable in accounting terms.  You&#x2019;ve actually used Accounts Receivable your whole life. If you&apos;ve ever earned a paycheck, you&apos;ve used accounts receivable: you performed work for your employer and you were paid, most likely, weekly or twice a month. You made the outlay by working and your paycheck, which you expect on a regular interval in the future, was an Account Receivable.        Why Do Accounts Receivable Matter?  Now that we know what it is, let&apos;s learn why Accounts Receivable is important. At a high level, it&apos;s important because it affects your cash flow. We&#x2019;ve talked about what cash flow is, why it matters and why it&#x2019;s important to keep inflow greater than outflow, but Accounts Receivable is sort of part of a no man&#x2019;s land between inflow and outflow. It will be inflow, but isn&apos;t yet. And since you made the outlay of the service or product, it&#x2019;s a cash outflow. But it will be returned. Having Accounts Receivable is a positive thing for your business: it means you&#x2019;re making sales which are an important first step towards business success. But the second step is just as important: collection.    Think of Accounts Receivable like mini loans to your customers; credit that you are extending because you&#x2019;ve paid for the inventory and delivered it to them or you&#x2019;ve performed a service for them and they still owe you. You&apos;re basically fronting for them. And the quicker the turnaround on Accounts Receivable the better. Great, you say, but how?    Set the Right Terms from the Start  Accounts Receivable can have varying payment terms and cycles. The typical payment cycle for goods or services ranges 30 to 90 days. It&apos;s up to you to negotiate the right payment terms in a contract from the get-go. The longer the payment term the more credit you are extending to your customers. Conversely, the shorter the payment term, the quicker you get your money&#x2014;theoretically. Set terms that work financially for you, but are also fair to your client/customer.  "

If Accounts Receivable is just sales, it&apos;s basically money in the proverbial bank, right? Not exactly. In the accounting world, Accounts Receivable is sort of like cash inflow &#x201C;in waiting.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s cash legally owed to you, which in theory is good, but it&#x2019;s not cash in hand. The same thing applies to accounts receivable. So exactly what is Accounts Receivable? Let&#x2019;s break it down&#x2026;       So What is Accounts Receivable Anyway?     When you make a sale and have delivered the product or performed the service, but your customer has yet to pay you for it, that amount of money is still coming to you. Cash &#x201C;to be received&#x201D; is filed under the category Accounts Receivable in accounting terms.   You&#x2019;ve actually used Accounts Receivable your whole life. If you&apos;ve ever earned a paycheck, you&apos;ve used accounts receivable: you performed work for your employer and you were paid, most likely, weekly or twice a month. You made the outlay by working and your paycheck, which you expect on a regular interval in the future, was an Account Receivable.         Why Do Accounts Receivable Matter?   Now that we know what it is, let&apos;s learn why Accounts Receivable is important. At a high level, it&apos;s important because it affects your cash flow. We&#x2019;ve talked about what cash flow is, why it matters and why it&#x2019;s important to keep inflow greater than outflow, but Accounts Receivable is sort of part of a no man&#x2019;s land between inflow and outflow. It will be inflow, but isn&apos;t yet. And since you made the outlay of the service or product, it&#x2019;s a cash outflow. But it will be returned. Having Accounts Receivable is a positive thing for your business: it means you&#x2019;re making sales which are an important first step towards business success. But the second step is just as important: collection.     Think of Accounts Receivable like mini loans to your customers; credit that you are extending because you&#x2019;ve paid for the inventory and delivered it to them or you&#x2019;ve performed a service for them and they still owe you. You&apos;re basically fronting for them. And the quicker the turnaround on Accounts Receivable the better. Great, you say, but how?     Set the Right Terms from the Start   Accounts Receivable can have varying payment terms and cycles. The typical payment cycle for goods or services ranges 30 to 90 days. It&apos;s up to you to negotiate the right payment terms in a contract from the get-go. The longer the payment term the more credit you are extending to your customers. Conversely, the shorter the payment term, the quicker you get your money&#x2014;theoretically. Set terms that work financially for you, but are also fair to your client/customer.

I always hate seeing days green over 30% in stocks i like, because as you said it normally means a pullback is possible however.    The float is small, and so locked up here, Its all a matter of when people want profit. nothing more.
