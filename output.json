    "content": "<span>It is the best you can do, now.  <br> There are people who manipulate the stock for months, and that is not what it should be! <br>  <br> I hope there is an investigation about it. Every time at the end of the day you can see a press to go unter the price of the day. That&apos;s really manipulation. <br>  <br> Bookvalue is 1.5$ and so the price is much and much to low. There must come a big correction. I have seen this before by other companies they can press the price unter without a reason. That&apos;s not the way a stockmarket should be right. Here it is really a shame, this can only happen in America. I have not seen it before in other countries.  <br>  <br> With more and more good news we got all the time, we must go every time higher, so who is manipulating the stock? <br>  <br> More good news:  <br> Washington State, Gov, Jay Inslee sign bill for recreational pot the state will grant licensing to those business paying taxes. <br>  <br> You are one of the good investors and I wish you good luck in all what you are doing!</span>"
